How does this game work?

First you enter a number in the first box called Min nr.
Then you enter a number in the second box called Max nr.

These numbers are the range that the random number can generate in.

The box Attempts is for the ammount of guesses that you want to take.

Once you are happy with your settings click the button that says "Generate and start!" to start the game,
a random number will be generated and you need to guess it.

the green bar indicates your guesses left, the slider indicates how close you are to the number, 
the lower the slider is the closer you are to the mistery number.

To guess a number put a number in the box that is labled "My guess" and click the button called
"Make Guess" to make the guess.

The program will notify you when you guessed the number or when you are out of guesses.
